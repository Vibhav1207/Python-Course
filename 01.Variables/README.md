## 📚 Introduction

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable, as Python is dynamically typed. This means you can assign different types of values to the same variable.

## 📜 String Variables

In this section, you'll learn about string variables in Python, including how to create them, perform operations like concatenation, slicing, and more.

### What is a String Variable?

A string variable is used to store text data. In Python, you can create a string variable by enclosing text in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed.

### Creating String Variables

You can create a string variable by assigning a string to a variable name.

```python
# Example of creating string variables
name = "John Doe"
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
print(name)         # Output: John Doe
print(greeting)     # Output: Hello, World!
```

### String Concatenation 

String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together. You can use the + operator to concatenate strings.
